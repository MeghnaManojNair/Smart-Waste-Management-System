# Smart-Waste-Management-System
Waste management has turned out to be one of the prime issues over the last few years leading to various other consequences and malfunctions in the society. Even though municipal corporations and authorities around the world have employed workers to clean and empty out garbage cans of their localities every once in few days, there are days when the garbage overflows lead to spillage of waste which attracts flies and spreads other diseases within the locality. Furthermore, in most of the cases the garbage cans are left unclean or are just washed with water which often leaves a lot of moisture content in the garbage can resulting in the growth of microbes and bacteria. In order to address this issue, we have proposed and elaborated on a smart waste management system which is automated and works using an Arduino board and a set of necessary sensors. Furthermore, we have also proposed an additional feature of automated sanitation to the smart waste management system which would make use of a sprinkler mechanism to sanitize the entire garbage can using solvents which are volatile and would dissolve the dirt present in the dustbin easily and evaporate.
